- 👋 Hi, I’m @EmperiorCyrus, I'm Brazilian and I live in Brazil.
- So far I have participated in 2 significant projects, both were from the institution where I study, the first was the creation of a user
     evaluation site with some analytical pages for the site's admin, and the second is the creation of a password management site and again with
     some pages for the admin, this time with more focus on SQL as it involves many databases.
     (No primeiro projeto, atuei como vice-líder da equipe de back-end, sendo responsável pela organização dos arquivos e auxiliando na lógica do site.
     Adicionalmente, atuei como mediador nas relações entre as demais equipes e o back-end).
     (Second project is still in progress).
- 👀 I'm interested in creating websites and wikis, as well as exploring how 2D game creation is done (I don't know much, but I'll learn).
- 🌱 For that I'm moving forward with my PHP and I'm getting to know a little more about JS and CSS.
- 💞️ I would like to contribute with what little I know and, at the same time, learn from different ideas in different ways.
